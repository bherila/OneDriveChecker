This is something I whipped up quickly to fill 2 needs:
    a) OneDrive on Mac has a very irritating problem when showing syncing problems. In the interest of being proactive running this program with the directory *before* syncing it to OneDrive might show you the issues so you can fix them.
    b) I wanted to try developing something in dotnet core on OSX.
    
Hopefully it works for you!
